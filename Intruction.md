# Project 1

Working with the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences this project will be the early stages of a final project of their design and goal. Using the below requirements as a starter your team's job is to design and implement the features below. Learning from the creation and working platform created in this project will help you for the next. This will not be a pretty project, but pieces that will work in concert.

The College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences have provided documents they use to schedule student advising appointments. These documents will (hopefully) be replaced by your teams’ website. How you integrate and design the webpages and DB to handle the data will be what you are graded on.

At current, the main contact for your project should be your instructor. The instructor will pass on any questions not able to answer to the college advising contacts. 

At no time are you allowed to use any pre-built coded libraries. This project will be done over time since you will be trained in class on how to accomplish all of the features below.

## 1. Advisor creator
- Collect basic data of Advisor

## 2. Advisor meeting creator
- A lot of data, how will you make it look nice?
- 8:00-4:30 possible range, 30 mins per meeting
- Office != meeting location
- Individual vs up to 10 people in one meeting
- Multiple majors in one group meeting

## 3. Advising Schedule Viewer
- Should be able to see what students signed up
- Debugging
- A lot of data, how will you make it look nice?

## 4. Student creator
- Assign to a meeting
- Collect basic data
- Major is important

> <sub><sup>We typically do mixed-major groups - the first-year (and some second-year) coursework is fairly similar across all majors, so we have a lot of students shifting interests as they figure out which areas they like more. Our list of majors is:

> <sub><sup>Biological Sciences BA <br>
> Biological Sciences BS <br>
> Biochemistry & Molecular Biology BS <br>
> Bioinformatics & Computational Biology BS <br>
> Biology Education BA <br>
> Chemistry BA <br>
> Chemistry BS <br>
> Chemistry Education BA <br>
> Computer Science <br>
> Computer Engineering <br>

> <sub><sup>The BA/BS distinctions are important to include for both BIOL and CHEM, because it makes a difference in the required MATH sequences.

- Filter by meeting
- Can sign up for only one meeting but can cancel

## Overall
- Video proof that this works
- No Javascript, Python (just HTML5, PHP, MySQL, CSS (maybe))
- No “libraries”
- Create database to have work together
- Do “research” - ask an advisor
- All pages interact with a database
- Consistency in look
- Documentation
- Website map
- For freshman and sophomore students

## -- Coding Requirements --
> HTML/XHTML/HTML 5
> CSS
- PHP
- MySQL
- Nothing outside of this list

## -- Documentation Requirements --
### Live Video (~5 minutes)
The video is be your means to prove you deserve full credit for everything BUT peer effort.  It can be as long as it needs to accomplish this. The opening "scene" of your video should have all of your teammate’s names and email addresses. You will place the video on YOUTUBE for easy access. Make sure it is set to “Unlisted”.  When submitting your project, have ONE text file named `VIDEO.txt` in the base directory with the URL to the video.

### Written documentation
Everything needed to have another group setup a new server and get this running. The document must be called `README.docx` and must be editable.

## -- Grading Details --
- Appearance: 10%
- Design of DB: 10%
- Overall design of webpages, using SIMPLE non-JavaScript ways to strict or validate student: 10%
- Code: 20%
	- Efficiency
	- Organization
	- Debugging Comments
- Validation: 10%
- Peer Effort: 20%  (lack or “know it all”)
- Documentation and Video: 20%

## -- Submitting --
- Code in .zip through GL
- Readme with link to live video
- Submission style is same as CMSC 341

starting from the same directory as your zip file:
`cp proj1.zip /afs/umbc.edu/users/s/l/slupoli/pub/cs331/USERNAME/proj1`

**Due: Please look at CMSC 331 Calendar on BB**
